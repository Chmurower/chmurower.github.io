# Welcome to Chmurower webpage!
_You can learn about or mission here!_

**Who?**

Chmurower is a crew of IT students who met on [WSB Merito University](https://www.merito.pl/wroclaw/)

As a guys, who during the years of studying, did manage to get
to know each other quite well and learned how to efficiently
cooperate, the choice to form Chmurower was almost natural.
"Group Project" course in WSB Merito is to teach us how to
colaborate in professional environment, with mentorship 
from [Wojciech Barczynski](https://github.com/wojciech11/).

**Why?**

Since we all love cycling in all form, and when travelling
abroad or being around local bike parks, we've often encountered
problems with organization of information, rental management
applications not working, or being hard to handle for employees
of bike rental places.

We've decided that we can make a difference, knowing our ways
around bikes, what people want from them, how to handle service 
and also being deep in the information technology industry,
it was only logical to develop this kind of application.

**What?**

With the above assumptions in mind, we've decided to develop
an easy to deploy, easy to use and easily servicable cloud
application called "Bike Rental".
App is designed to be deployed on private as well as public cloud,
with ~~all~~ some of the necessary scripts needed for seamless
integration.
(at this moment, implementation is ready for private cloud
 and for Azure App Service)

**How?**

Since before starting the project we've already knew some
technologies that could easily serve as a
our project will be focused on building an

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
